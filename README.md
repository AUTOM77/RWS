1. Implementation **Wireguard** protocol in Rust with `eBPF-driven` optimization
2. Asynchronous acquisition for WARP Plus Subscription with `tokio`
3. Apply the `Socks5` proxy protocol with username/password authentication to enhance privacy and bypass firewalls
4. Enable `curve25519` encryption with `x25519_dalek` implementation of x25519 key exchange algorithm

## Usage

`rws-cli -d ${DEVICE_ID} -i ${INTERFACE-NAME} -p ${SOCKS5-PORT} -U ${USER:PASSWD}`
